Quick and dirty python script to read properties of PDF files across a file system.
Accesses a SQL database via ODBC to retrieve file locations.
It will not run as-is, obviously, since it depends on a specific database schema.

The PyPDF library is used, as well as a more 'manual' approach - reading page markers from the plain text of a PDF file.
This proved to be necessary since the PyPDF module has trouble with certain PDF versions.
