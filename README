Quick and dirty python script to read properties of PDF files  
across a file system.  It accesses a SQL database via ODBC to  
retrieve file locations.  

It will not run as-is, obviously, since it depends on a specific  
database schema.

The PyPDF library is used, as well as a more 'manual' approach :  
reading page markersfrom the plain text of a PDF file.  This proved  
to be necessary since the PyPDF modulehas trouble with certain PDF  
versions.

Although this is by now old code (almost 2 years), I am quite proud  
of this little script.  It was my second fully functional script, and  
my first non-trivial piece of code.  In particular, I had a lot of fun  
learning to retrieve data from a SQL database as well as having to work  
around the version limitations of PyPDF.
