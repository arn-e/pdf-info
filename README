Quick and fun python script to determine of PDF files across a  
file system.  It takes a delimited list of filenames as input  
and accesses a SQL database via ODBC to retrieve the location of  
the files to be scanned.  It could just as easily have been built  
to use an input list of full relative paths, however this information  
was already stored in a database.

It will not run as-is, obviously, since it depends on a specific  
database schema.  The field names have been replaced with generic  
placeholders.

The PyPDF library is used, as well as a more 'manual' approach :  
reading page markers from the plain text of a PDF file.  This proved  
to be necessary since the PyPDF module has trouble with certain PDF  
versions, such as 1.3 and 1.6.

Although this is by now old code, I am quite proud of this little  
script.  It was my second fully functional script, and my first  
non-trivial piece of code.  In particular, I had a lot of fun  
learning to retrieve data from a SQL database as well as having  
to work around the version limitations of PyPDF.
